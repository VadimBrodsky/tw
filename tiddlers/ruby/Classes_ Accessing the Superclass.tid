title: Classes: Accessing the Superclass
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* To change the behavior of a superclass' method without completely overriding it.
* The keyword `super` is used for that.
* It returns the result of the original method to where `super` is called.

```ruby
class Pig < Animal
	def noise
		parent_noise = super
		return "Hello and also #{parent_noise}"
	end
end

wilbur = Pig.new
wilbur.make_noise
```
