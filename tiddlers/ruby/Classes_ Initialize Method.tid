title: Classes: Initialize Method
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Methods that run when the object is being initialized.
* Use the `initialize` class method.
* Can pass arguments to the `initialize` method, the `new` method uses them.

```ruby
class Animal
	def initialize(noise, legs, arms)
		@noise = noise
		@legs = legs
		@arms = arms
		puts "A new animal has been instantiated."
	end
end

animal = Animal.new("Moo", 4, 0)
```
