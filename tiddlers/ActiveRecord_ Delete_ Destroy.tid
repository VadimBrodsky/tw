type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Firstly you need to find the record to destroy it. After the `destroy` method the object is transitioning from being //hydrated// (all attributes retained) to //frozen// (can't modify attributes).

```ruby
article = Article.last
article.destroy
```

```ruby
Article.last.destroy
Article.destroy(1)
```
