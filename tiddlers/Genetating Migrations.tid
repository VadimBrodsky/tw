type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* Migrations reside in the `/db/migrate` folder of the Rails application.
* To generate a migration use the [[Rails Generate]] command.
* Migration names are written in camel case:

```bash
rails generate migration DoNothingYet
```

* Rails generates a new migration when a model is generated.
