title: HTTP Operations
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* `GET` is the most common HTTP operation, used for reading data on the web; it just means “get a page”,
* `POST` is the next most common operation; it is the request sent by your browser when you submit a form. In Rails applications, `POST` requests are typically used for creating things.
* `PATCH` and `DELETE`, are designed for updating and destroying things on the remote server. These requests are less common than `GET` and `POST` since browsers are incapable of sending them natively.
