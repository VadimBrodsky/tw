title: Running the Database Migration
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

* To update the database based on changes in the code run a migration.
* To make sure that the right version of Rake runs use the `bundle exec` addition.
* To see all available rake tasks run `bundle exec rake -T`.

```bash
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
